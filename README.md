# RailNavigator

**RailNavigator** app enhances the navigation experience within railway stations through the integration of real-time data, augmented reality technology, and vital station information. Here is an in-depth view about how the **Railway Station Navigation** system functions through the app:

### 1. Real-Time Navigation
- **User Location Tracking**: This app is going to use GPS tracking in the real-time location of users within the railway station. As long as a user keeps on changing locations, his position would be reflected on the map to help him navigate through the physical layout of the station.
- **Locate Facilities**: App users may look for any number of different facilities, including food stalls, toilets, waiting areas, and so on. It will show them the nearest available facility and send them in the right direction to get there【7†source】.

### 2. AR Navigation
- **AR Navigation**: The end users are navigated through the station using **3D AR arrows** overlaid on the camera feed once AR mode is turned on, that point out to key facilities and exits.
- **Dynamic Updating of AR Directions**: The AR system updates immediately on the basis of movements to ensure arrows always point in the right direction toward the chosen facility or platform【7†source】.
   - **Graphic Directional Indicators**: In addition to arrows, other AR graphics like symbols for **vending machines for food, washrooms, and platforms** appear in the camera view to make the experience friendly for users.

### 3. **Facility Information and Amenities**
   - The app sheds light on the most important facilities or amenities on the railway station, such as:
     - Toilets. Distinguish with signboards so that you know where the nearest toilet is located
     - Movable or stationary food courts/stalls: The app could take you to railway station places where you can eat within the area and informs how far the place is and the expected walking time.
- **ATMs**: For users that will use cash, the map and augmented reality views show the nearest ATMs.
  Wheelchair Accessible: Stations providing accessible areas are noted in case users require such accessibility needs【6†source】【7†source】.
- **Platform Information**: As users reach the platforms, actual platform information like train schedules and numbers appears in the AR view so that users can quickly access important information without an app switch.

### 4. **Map View for Station Layout
- **Interactive Map**: Users can toggle to a standard map view in order to see a full layout of the station. The map displays:
- **Location of the User Currently**: It is marked with a pin for easy identification by users of where they are
- **Facility Locations**: Places containing toilets, food stalls, platforms, and services are all highlighted
- **Compatibility with Search**: The map integrates automatically with the search in that it lets the user click on any location and view the distance and directions【7†source】.
- **Routing**: Whenever you select a destination, it will automatically determine the best routing within the station and give you turn-by-turn directions in either map view or AR.

### 5. Estimated Time and Distance
   - **Distance to Destination**: The moment that one picks up a facility or platform, the app begins to calculate and display the distance (in kilometers or meters) from the current location.
- **Time Estimate**: With the use of an estimate of a user's walking speed and route, this application informs them of how much time it will take to reach a destination they seek; it is very helpful for travelers who have to abide by a strict schedule【7†source】.

### 6. **Alarm and Notification System
- **Proximity alerts**: The application will alert a user approaching, for instance, either a food stall or a restroom; it will also alert the user that they are approaching the end of their platform
   - **Alarm on stations**: Users have reminders on approaching stations. The feature ensures that users do not miss a stop even when busy in an activity, either sleeping or eating【6†source】.

#### 7. Crowd Density Indicators
   Crowd Density Information - Real-Time: In stations, crowd density is a problem especially during peak times. In the app, real-time crowd density data is shown for locations within the station:
- **Low, Medium and High Density**: The application utilizes a bar that will turn colour depending on how busy a space is. These help users avoid really busy or congested places or find areas that are less noisy 6†source】 .

### Use Case Example
There is a tourist who has just arrived to a huge railway station that he hasn't ever been in. The tourist opens the **RailNavigator** application the moment he arrives. The app identifies where they are and they make use of the **search bar** in order to get information about where the nearest food stall is located. Once a destination is chosen, the application indicates the route on the map; however the traveler resorts to **AR mode** so as to be guided through 3D arrows pointing towards the food stall. In the process, they get crowd density real time so that they could avoid being in the crowded areas.

Once aboard and fed, they set an **alarm** at their destination station, content in the knowledge that their app will alert them to board their train.
